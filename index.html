              <p>Working for FEP (Fedaral Employee Program) division of the company, I currently lead development effort in getting other health insurance companies on board to use our platform - cementing our position as SaaS provider. We developed this platform and suite of different applcations over past few years where I worked as senior and lead developer. Applications that I lead includes apps written in cloud technologies - Salesforce - and other web apps and processes utilizing Java &amp; JavaEE based applications.

              <p>When I joined the FEP division in the company as senior developer, we started working on migrating the core claims processing engine from HIPAA 4010 standards to 5010 standards. This was core piece of the overall FEP strategy. Main objective of claims engine was to accept the claims from our vendor partners, hospitals and providers, and then preparing those claims for preadjudication by processing it through various pluggable components. The architecture was on the lines of what is now very popular microservices architecture (though it is not purely microservices architecture). Once the claim processing system was built, a new UI based application was develped to give visibility to end users into various aspects of the claim - This new app was named service console. As the months went by, few other apps and batch processes were built to support claims processing (including post adjudication and voucher processing). </p>
              <p>At one point in 2014, the leadership decided to sunset old mainframe based applications that our customer service reps were using, and replace it with new system built on Salesforce platform. I started working on this new CRM app for Salesforce and learned salesforce in the process. We built 3 more apps named Workflow, Sales and CaseTrack after that - all hightly customized apps running on Salesforce's cloud platform for different set of users in the business. The company started to market our capabilities and platform - which was custom built for FEP business - to other blue health insurance plans and got a few plans signed up to use our suite of apps and platform. I have grown and learned a lot - along with growing team about various aspect of the business and how our innovative technology solution was having great positive impact on the company.</p>

              <p>I joined the supply chain solutions division of UPS (largest parcel service company in the world) as java developer to help with developing a JavaEE based product named RTM (Rapid Transportation Management). Though the name implies that the product was transportation management product, it was primarily an order management system. Used by UPS's business around the globe, this product was used to manage the supply chain business of the company, a business with revenues of several hundred million dollars at that time. This product was to replace an aging and out of support product named Vantive. I worked on adding several features to the app after studying how it was done in Vantive and ended up working on one of the most crucial component called routing engine. This was custom built algorithm to decide the fastest or most optimal and cost effective way of moving the item from point A to point B. After the system was live and used in production, I moved to another part of the business, dabbling in another project called Warehouse Management System. This system was built using old technologies and was used to facilitate pick, pack and shipping of products from the warehouse. I was tasked with doing feasibility study to migrate this system to newer platform/technology and I did POC as part of that effort.</p>
